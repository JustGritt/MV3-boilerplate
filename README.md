# Manifest-V3-boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for a Chrome extension using Manifest V3 that I created for personal use to quickstart multiple small projects but feel free to use it as well if you want.

> Since Manifest V2 is deprecated, I decided to create a boilerplate for Manifest V3. This boilerplate is based on the [Chrome Extension Quick Start](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/quickstart/).

## Requirements

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (or any Chromium-based browser like [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), etc.)
- That's it.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Load the extension by clicking on the `Load unpacked` button and selecting the boilerplate folder
4. You're done! âœ¨
